CASE – 8689439
History of Present Illness:
Verbal consent obtained for use of AutoScribe during this visit.

Patient has experienced digestive problems throughout their life, including regurgitation, which has persisted since childhood. They report that their symptoms are triggered by consuming acidic or carbonated foods, such as soda, tomato-based sauces, and garlic. When triggered, patient experiences constant nausea and vomiting, which can last for a week. During the first few days of a flare-up, patient typically fasts due to difficulty in stomaching anything. They mention that it takes a while for them to digest anything, and if they vomit after eating, the food will be only halfway digested after a few hours.

Patient also reports having constipation, which they manage by taking Miralax daily, although they have not taken it in a few weeks. They have not been evaluated by a gastroenterologist before and have been prescribed pantoprazole, sucralafate, and Zofran as needed by their primary care physician, Dr. Snyder. Patient takes these medications during flare-ups, which usually resolve within four days. They have not had an endoscopy or colonoscopy in the past and deny any family history of colon cancer or polyps.

Patient has made dietary modifications to avoid triggering foods and has noticed improvements in their symptoms when adhering to these changes. They have not been tested for celiac disease or H. pylori infection.
